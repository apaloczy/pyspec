## A Pythonic package for spectral analysis ##

This is an on-going project in which I'm gathering stuff that I've been developing for my own research in oceanography. Contributions are very welcome.

## Installation ##

This is a legit python package. You can install it

	python setup.py install

If you want to develop and contribute to the project, set up the development mode

	python setup.py develop

## Usage ##

Here are some simple examples 

*An IPython [notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/crocha700/pyspec/blob/master/examples/example_1d_spec.ipynb) describing a single calculation of one-dimensional wavenumber spectra.
